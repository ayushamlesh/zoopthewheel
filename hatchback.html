				<div class="second">With the Impact 2.0 design language, the updated Tata Tiago not only looks much more appealing,
									it also appears more mature than before. The sweeping headlamps and sharp grille add to this
									updated design but the rear remains more or less unchanged. However, the updated cabin gets
									newer features to keep the Tiago relevant for entry-level hatchback buyers.

									CNG version for Grand i10 Nios ranges between ₹ 8.07 Lakh - ₹ 8.68 Lakh

									The Grand i10 Nios, with its striking design, is now an able competitor against the
									Maruti Suzuki Swift in terms of looks. Sure, it isn’t exactly fun to drive and has a busy ride.
									But, it comes with premium interiors, is loaded with features and offers the convenience of an
									automatic (AMT) even with the diesel engine and an option of CNG as well.
									And if Hyundai’s service is anything to go by, it will be a fuss-free hatchback to own.

									The new-gen Hyundai i20 drops the ‘Elite’ from its name and takes the game forward
									 with its striking looks and many first-in-class features. As before, it is spacious on
									the inside, but we expected slightly improved material quality especially since everything
									else has moved up a notch. What’s more, with no less than five powertrain choices, there’s an i20 for everyone.
									 Overall, the new i20 remains a proper family hatch with added razzle-dazzle.

									cabin has ample space and is feature-packed. The cherry on the cake is the pricing and
									wide service backing from Maruti's Nexa dealerships. Overall, the Baleno is the most affordable
